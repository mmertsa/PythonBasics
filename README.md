# PythonBasics

<p>
Python was the first language I programmed with back in the university. I was 
studying English as my major and decided to take a beginner programming course
just for fun. During that course I learned to code very simple code with 
Python and really enjoyed the course. A few years later I am studying 
ICT Engineering and constatly learning more about programming!

Here you can find simple examples of how to code with Python, these examples
are my own code and are far from perfect as I explain them how I understand 
Python. I find Python coherent as a programming language as I was able to 
understand the syntax quite quickly even if I had never programmed before. This
repo is done mainly for me to just keep notes for learning purposes but
if you are interested go ahead and take a look! Just remember, that there might
be some mistakes here and there as I am just at the beginning of my programming
journey :smiley:
