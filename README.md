# PythonBasics

<p>
Python was the first programming language I came across in university. I was studying English as my major and decided to take a beginner programming course just for fun. During that course, I learned to write very simple code in Python and really enjoyed the experience. A few years later, I am now studying ICT Engineering and constantly learning more about programming!

Here, you can find simple examples of how to code with Python. These examples are my own code and are far from perfect, as I explain them based on my understanding of Python. I find Python to be a coherent programming language, and I was able to grasp the syntax quite quickly even though I had never programmed before. This repository is mainly for me to keep notes for learning purposes, but if you are interested, feel free to take a look! Just remember that there might be some mistakes here and there, as I am just at the beginning of my programming journey. :smiley:
