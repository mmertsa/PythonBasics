# Basics to get started with Python

Python was the first language I programmed with back in the university. I was 
studying English as my major and decided to take a beginner programming course
just for fun. During that course I learned to code very simple code with 
Python and really enjoyed the course. A few years later I am studying 
ICT Engineering and constatly learning more about programming!

Here you can find simple examples of how to code with Python, these examples
are my own code that I have learned dusring my studies.
