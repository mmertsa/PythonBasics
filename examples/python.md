# Basics to get started with Python
<p>
Python was the first language I programmed with back in the university.<br> 
I was studying English as my major and decided to take a beginner programming <br>
course just for fun. During that course I learned to code very simple code with <br>
Python and really enjoyed the course. A few years later I am studying <br>
ICT Engineering and constatly learning more about programming!

Here you can find simple examples of how to code with Python, these examples
are my own code that I have learned dusring my studies.

    hinta = summa * 1.24
    return round(hinta, 2)


summa1 = float(input("Anna hinta ilman alv: "))
alvsumma = alvinhinta(summa1)
print(f"Hinta alvin kanssa: {alvsumma} €")
